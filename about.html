        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
          I’m an aspiring front-end engineer who started learning software
          development a little over a year ago. My journey began with curiosity
          and has grown into a genuine passion for building clean, functional,
          and user-friendly web interfaces. I enjoy learning new technologies,
          experimenting with layouts, and seeing my progress come to life
          through projects. Right now, I’m focused on strengthening my skills in
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, while also exploring the basics of
          cybersecurity.

        <h2>Goals in this Program</h2>
        <p>
          My main goal is to grow from just understanding concepts to applying
          them confidently in real projects. I want to complete every task with
          consistency and clarity — not just to pass, but to truly learn. I hope
          to become skilled enough to contribute meaningfully to a team, handle
          front-end challenges independently, and prepare for my first tech
          role. Most importantly, I want to develop the discipline and structure
          that will help me keep improving long after this program ends.

      <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
        <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes I struggle with self-doubt, especially when I see others
          making faster progress. I also feel less confident when it comes to
          backend topics, advanced JavaScript patterns, or explaining technical
          ideas on the spot. But I’m learning that growth takes time — and that
          consistency is more powerful than comparison. My plan is to keep
          facing those weak spots one at a time until they become strengths.

        <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
        <p>
          Dear Future Me, if you’re reading this, I hope you’ve seen how far
          you’ve come. Remember that every night you spent learning and every
          moment you pushed through doubt was worth it. Keep that same hunger to
          learn, stay humble, and never forget why you started. You don’t need
          to have everything figured out — just keep building, keep growing, and
          stay close to your purpose.

        <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          This journey has shown me that real progress is built on small, steady
          steps. Some days I feel behind, but those are the days that teach me
          the most about patience and persistence. I’ve also realised that
          sharing knowledge and connecting with others in tech not only helps me
          grow faster but makes the journey less lonely. My goal is to always
          keep that collaborative spirit, even when things get tough.
